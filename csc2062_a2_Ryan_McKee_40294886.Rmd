# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl + Shift + Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl + Alt + I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl + Shift + K* to preview the HTML file).
 
The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Personalising the notebook

In the notebook header and in the preamble.tex file, change "Student Name" to your name. This should be **exactly** as it appears on Canvas. Replace "Student Number" with your student number. Make sure the file is named with *your* student name and *your* student number as follows: `csc2062_a2_barry_devereux_4012345.Rmd`.

When you submit your work, ensure that the latest `.html` and `.pdf` renderings of the notebook are present.

## Importing code

In general, you can just present your code in the R chunks in this notebook. In a some cases where you have more complex pieces of code (e.g. function definitions) you may wish to have that code implemented in a seperate R file. The code can then be imported into the notebook using the *source* command. You do not need more than at most one ancillary code file per section. 

In the example R imported below file below, there is a number of functions, including *squarenumbers*,
which gives the squares of the numbers 1 to a, for any positive integer a.

```{r}
source("./section1_code.r")
```


Let's calculate the result of the function for the numbers 5 to 10:

```{r}
numbers = c(5:10)
for (number in numbers) {
  print(squarenumbers(number))
}
```


In general, as you develop your code, you may find it convenient to write and test it in a standard `.r` file, before adding the working code to this notebook.

## Word count

If you want to check the wordcount of your notebook (excluding code), you can install the [wordcount](https://github.com/barry/wordcountaddin) Rstudio addin by Ben Marwick.

Follow the installation and use instructions at the link above.

```{r}
wordcountaddin:::text_stats()
```

## Introduction

The overall objective of this project is to create A.I. that will be able to recognize letters in the set {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j}, as well as recognize smiley faces, sad faces and exclamation
marks. In this part of the assignment(assignment 2) My goals are to create a dataset of hand drawn letters, smiley faces, sad faces and exclamation marks. Then perform feature engineering on
these images to calculate features such as how many black pixels exist in the image and aspect ratio. Then perform statistical analysis of the datasets using methods of statistical inference such
as using histograms and finally for this assignment implement and evaluate some machine learning models that perform classification on the dataset.

# Section 1

I created my dataset images for letters in set {a,...,j}, smiley faces, sad faces and exclamation marks using GIMP and exporting these images as PGM files type ASCII this file type showed images 

```{r}
source('./section1_code.R')
```
