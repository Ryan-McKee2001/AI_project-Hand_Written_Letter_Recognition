# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl + Shift + Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl + Alt + I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl + Shift + K* to preview the HTML file).
 
The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Personalising the notebook

In the notebook header and in the preamble.tex file, change "Student Name" to your name. This should be **exactly** as it appears on Canvas. Replace "Student Number" with your student number. Make sure the file is named with *your* student name and *your* student number as follows: `csc2062_a2_barry_devereux_4012345.Rmd`.

When you submit your work, ensure that the latest `.html` and `.pdf` renderings of the notebook are present.

## Importing code

In general, you can just present your code in the R chunks in this notebook. In a some cases where you have more complex pieces of code (e.g. function definitions) you may wish to have that code implemented in a seperate R file. The code can then be imported into the notebook using the *source* command. You do not need more than at most one ancillary code file per section. 

In the example R imported below file below, there is a number of functions, including *squarenumbers*,
which gives the squares of the numbers 1 to a, for any positive integer a.

```{r}
source("./section1_code.r")
```


Let's calculate the result of the function for the numbers 5 to 10:

```{r}
numbers = c(5:10)
for (number in numbers) {
  print(squarenumbers(number))
}
```


In general, as you develop your code, you may find it convenient to write and test it in a standard `.r` file, before adding the working code to this notebook.

## Word count

If you want to check the wordcount of your notebook (excluding code), you can install the [wordcount](https://github.com/barry/wordcountaddin) Rstudio addin by Ben Marwick.

Follow the installation and use instructions at the link above.

```{r}
wordcountaddin:::text_stats()
```

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to create A.I. that will be able to recognize letters in the set {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j}, as well as recognize smiley faces, sad faces and exclamation
marks.
